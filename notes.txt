Next Steps

  1. With PostgreSQL running and .env pointing at the right role, rerun npm run migrate and then npm run start to boot the API.
  2. Exercise POI CRUD + analytics endpoints; JSON payload handling and CSV import paths changed slightly, so a smoke test helps ensure no
     runtime regressions.
  3. When satisfied, commit the backend changes alongside the earlier dependency bumps.
